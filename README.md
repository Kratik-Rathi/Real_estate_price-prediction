# Real_estate_price-prediction
This project aims to build a linear regression model to predict house prices. Linear regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In the context of house price prediction, the dependent variable is the house price, and the independent variables can be factors such as the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, the location, etc.

The project will use a dataset of house prices and other relevant factors to train the linear regression model. Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the prices of new houses based on their characteristics.

The project will evaluate the performance of the linear regression model using the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) metrics. The MAE measures the average difference between the actual and predicted values, while the RMSE measures the standard deviation of the differences between the actual and predicted values.

Conclusion

This project will demonstrate how to build a linear regression model to predict house prices. The project will also show how to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model using the MAE and RMSE metrics.

Potential Applications

The linear regression model developed in this project can be used by a variety of stakeholders, including:

Real estate agents: Real estate agents can use the model to estimate the value of homes for their clients.
Homebuyers: Homebuyers can use the model to get a better understanding of the housing market and to make more informed decisions when buying a home.
Lenders: Lenders can use the model to assess the risk of lending money to homebuyers.
Investors: Investors can use the model to identify undervalued homes that have the potential to appreciate in value.
Future Work

The linear regression model developed in this project can be improved in a number of ways, such as:

Using more data: The more data used to train the model, the more accurate the predictions will be.
Using additional features: There are a number of other factors that can affect house prices, such as the quality of the school district, the proximity to amenities, and the crime rate. Adding these features to the model may improve its accuracy.
Using other machine learning algorithms: There are a number of other machine learning algorithms that can be used for house price prediction, such as random forests and gradient boosting machines. These algorithms may outperform linear regression on certain datasets.
